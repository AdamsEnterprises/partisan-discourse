Partisan Discourse is straightforward to use. But before users can begin interacting with the app, make sure that it's running (see the last step of the [developers' quick start guide](/index.md) if you have questions).

Then, users can do the following:

**Log into the app.** If it's hosted locally (per the developers' quick start guide), then just type **127:0.0.1:8000** into your browser. You should see the following splash page:

**Visit the website of any current political news article and paste the URL into the appropriate box at the top of the screen.** Click "Go." On the right-hand side of the screen, click on the buttons "Democratic" and "Republican" to classify the article one way or the other.
